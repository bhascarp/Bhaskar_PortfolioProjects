1. Walmart Data-Retail Analysis in PYTHON

Overview:

One of the leading retail stores in the US, Walmart, would like to predict the sales and demand accurately. The business needs to understand the sales in their 45 stores and the impact of holidays and other factors. So, the objective of this project is to do the data analysis and provide insights to the stakeholders.

The data was available for years 2010, 2011 and 2012.

The analysis answered below key questions:

1. Which store is performing well and has a good growth rate? How significant are they from one another?
2. How are sales at different time periods?
3. Are the holidays affecting the sales in the stores? If so, how significant compared to non-holiday days?
4. Did the factors: temperature on day of sale, fuel price in the region, prevailing consumer price index and prevailing unemployment rate have an impact on the sales?

2. Customer Churn Analysis in PYTHON

Understanding Customer Churn:

Customer churn refers to when a customer ends his or her relationship with a business.

Acquiring new customers can be several times more expensive than selling to existing ones. Understanding what drives churn and why customers are churning is crucial in maintaining high retention rates. Being able to accurately identify those customers at high risk of churning, may help us to create appropriate marketing strategies and retain our customers.
